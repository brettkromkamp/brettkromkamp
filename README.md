## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile.

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), [StoryDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/story-db) and a couple of other open source projects.

Expect many of my projects and accompanying repositories to be related to the intersection of [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), content management and [information architecture](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture-for-ux-designers.html#gs.hq0on5) using topic maps-based &mdash;semantic&mdash; technologies.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend web framework
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for 3D web content

### Current Focus - November 2020

* Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.
* Developing an application that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 3D environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and superimposing the selected object over the user's view of the real world (that is, AR). A demo with the initial prototype of the *Storyteller* application is available here: [Space Colony](https://brettkromkamp.com/space-colony/index.html?story-identifier=11&event-identifier=industrial-sector).
