## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile. I am a software developer and technologist providing solutions based on semantic technologies and [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph).

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), [EventDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/event-db) and a couple of other open source projects.

Expect many of my projects and accompanying repositories to be related to the intersection of knowledge management and content management using topic maps-based &mdash;semantic&mdash; technologies.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend web framework
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources

I'm currently learning [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/) while working on the *Storyteller* project, an interactive 3D storytelling web application based on [semantic events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/).
