## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile. Find me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@brettkromkamp).

I am currently working on a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)-based cross-platform note-taking and (personal) knowledge management application. Note-taking and knowledge management is a [crowded space](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/awesome-knowledge-management). My contribution to this plethora of approaches and applications in this space is based on [topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) and [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/), respectively.

My latest blog post is [Three.js Development in 2023](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/three-js-development-in-2023/).

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db) and a couple of other open source projects. I also have several published Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/brettkromkamp/). Expect many of my projects to be related to __knowledge graph__-based applications combined with procedural generation together with 2D and 3D visualization systems.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework for building APIs
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) web framework
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript 3D library
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) building mobile, web, and desktop applications from a single codebase
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) describing knowledge structures and associating them with information resources

### Contextualise Experiments

#### Knowledge Graph-based Content Management

Combining labeled property graphs with [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/), a topic maps-based content and knowledge management system. 

#### Reveal.js-Based Knowledge Paths

Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.

#### Mixing Art and Code to Build Engaging Web Experiences

Development of web content models, concepts, creation processes and tools: mix art and code to build interactive, [engaging web experiences](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/engaging-web-experiences/)

### Story Technologies

#### Storytelling With Interactive Visualisation of Semantic Events

Developing a combined Angular and Phaser-based web application &mdash;for storytelling purposes&mdash; that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 2.5D, isometric environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and high-lighting a set of objects by tag. Narratives are [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) topic maps.
