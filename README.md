## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile.

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db) and a couple of other open source projects. I also have several published Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/brettkromkamp/). Expect many of my projects to be related to the combination of __linked data and knowledge graph-based applications__.

Core technologies I work with, include:

* [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) and related graph technologies including [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html), [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/) and [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html)
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) standard to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite

### Contextualise Experiments

#### Knowledge Graph-based Content Management

Combining labeled property graphs with [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/), a topic maps-based content and knowledge management system. 

#### Reveal.js-Based Knowledge Paths

Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.

#### Mixing Art and Code to Build Engaging Web Experiences

Development of web content models, concepts, creation processes and tools: mix art and code to build interactive, [engaging web experiences](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/engaging-web-experiences/)

#### Storytelling With Interactive Visualisation of Semantic Events (The Story Technologies Project)

Developing a web application &mdash;for storytelling purposes&mdash; that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 3D environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and superimposing the selected object over the user's view of the real world (that is, augmented reality). Narratives are [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) topic maps.
