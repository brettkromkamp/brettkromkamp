## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile.

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), [StoryDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/story-db) and a couple of other open source projects.

Expect many of my projects and accompanying repositories to be related to the intersection of [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), content management and [information architecture](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture-for-ux-designers.html#gs.hq0on5) using topic maps-based &mdash;semantic&mdash; technologies.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend web framework
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for 3D web content

### Current Focus - October 2020

I'm currently extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) with the ability to seamlessly switch between two (dramatically) different user experiences: a knowledge path &mdash;presentation-like&mdash; user interface on one hand versus a full-fledged knowledge graph &mdash;semantic modelling&mdash; user interface on the other hand.
