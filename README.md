## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile. Find me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@brettkromkamp).

I am working on the next version of [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/), a personal knowledge management application. Knowledge management is a [crowded space](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/awesome-knowledge-management). My contribution to the plethora of approaches and applications in this space is based on a combination of semantic technologies and language model workflows.

**I ask everyone to support the people of Ukraine who are being invaded by Russia**. [Donate now](https://supportukrainenow.org/).

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db) and a couple of other open source projects. I also have several published Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/brettkromkamp/). Expect many of my projects to be related to __semantic technologies__, data pipelines and large language models.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* LLM-based applications with [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) frameworks
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) describing knowledge structures and associating them with information resources
* [Kuzu](https://kuzudb.com) in-process labeled property graph database with Cypher query language support
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework for building APIs
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) web framework

### Contextualise Projects

#### Contextualise AI

Contextualise AI is a software platform that enables users to transform relevant data into meaningful insights, leveraging concepts they already understand. It simplifies complex information, making it easier to comprehend and explore.

#### Reveal.js-Based Knowledge Paths

Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.

#### Mixing Art and Code to Build Engaging Web Experiences

Development of web content models, concepts, creation processes and tools: mix art and code to build interactive, [engaging web experiences](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/engaging-web-experiences/)

### Story Technologies

#### Storytelling With Interactive Visualisation of Semantic Events

Developing a combined Angular and [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)-based web application &mdash;for storytelling purposes&mdash; that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 2.5D, isometric environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and high-lighting a set of objects by tag. Narratives are [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) topic maps.
