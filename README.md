## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile.

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), [StoryDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/story-db) and a couple of other open source projects.

Expect many of my projects to be related to the development of engaging interactive content using a combination of topic maps-based &mdash;semantic&mdash; technologies together with web-based 3D and [WebXR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) technologies.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for 3D web content
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game framework for web-based 2D game development

### Current Projects: Contextualise Experiments

#### Building the Discover Programming! Course (Estimated Release Date: 4th Quarter of 2021)

Developing a course for people that want to have a great **learning experience** while learning how to program. The course will focus on providing the learner with all of the necessary programming knowledge and skills to build several small &mdash;but, fully functional and attractive&mdash; 2D games.

#### Mixing Art and Code to Build Engaging Content Experiences

Development of web content models, concepts, creation processes and tools: mix art and code to build highly [engaging and unique content experiences](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/engaging-web-experiences/).

#### Reveal.js-Based Knowledge Paths

Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.

#### Storytelling With Interactive Visualisation of Semantic Events

Developing a web application &mdash;for storytelling purposes&mdash; that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 3D environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and superimposing the selected object over the user's view of the real world (that is, augmented reality). Narratives are [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) topic maps.
