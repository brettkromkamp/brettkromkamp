## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

You've reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile. Find me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@brettkromkamp).

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db) and a couple of other open source projects. I also have several published Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/brettkromkamp/).

Projects I am currently working on, include:

* __Emotional Companion__, an [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) app using the [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) programming language
* __Contextualise__, a knowledge management system using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) web framework

### Contextualise Projects

#### Contextualise Knowledge Management System
Contextualise is an effective tool particularly suited for organising information-heavy projects and activities consisting of unstructured and widely diverse data and information resources

#### Reveal.js-Based Knowledge Paths

Extending [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) to include a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)-based presentation mode to supplement the existing [knowledge path](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/knowledge-paths/) feature.

#### Mixing Art and Code to Build Engaging Web Experiences

Development of web content models, concepts, creation processes and tools: mix art and code to build interactive, [engaging web experiences](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/engaging-web-experiences/)

### Story Technologies

#### Storytelling With Interactive Visualisation of Semantic Events

Developing a combined Angular and [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)-based web application &mdash;for storytelling purposes&mdash; that allows a user to navigate between a collection of [narrative events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/). Each event has an accompanying 2.5D, isometric environment with participants and items that can be interacted with. Interactions include (but, are not limited to) displaying more information about the selected object and high-lighting a set of objects by tag. Narratives are [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev/) topic maps.
