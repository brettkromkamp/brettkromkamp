## Brett Kromkamp's GitHub Profile

Youâ€™ve reached [Brett Kromkamp](https://brettkromkamp.com/)'s GitHub profile. Welcome!

I am a Python and JavaScript developer in addition to being a semantic technologies and 3D/[WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/) enthusiast.

I contribute to and maintain [Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise), [TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), [EventDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/event-db) and a couple of other open source projects.

Expect many of my projects and accompanying repositories to be related to (personal and collaborative) [knowledge management](https://contextualise.dev/) and semantic modelling in combination with WebXR applications.

Technologies I enjoy working with, include:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend web framework
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for 3D web content
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database
* [Topic maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html) provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract concepts and real-world (information) resources

I'm currently learning [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/) and working on the "Story Teller" project, an interactive 3D storytelling web application based on [semantic events](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/narrative-events/).
